# Artificial-Intelligence
AI is currently dominated by a single idea: Deep Learning. Driverless cars, personal assistants, Go and chess grandmasters, website recommenders, x-ray diagnosis, psychedelic art... All these and many other exciting AI applications are based on training machines to recognise patterns â€“ specifically, on really really large neural networks.

So that's what we will be exploring.

Deep Learning.

We will be using the industry-standard development tool: Google's Tensorflow.
We will be following a recent text book that has become more or less the standard resource on the subject: Deep Learning with Python (DLWP), Second Edition, by Francois Chollet. M. Chollet is a Google engineer who developed much of that code base. Digital and physical copies of the book are available at the library, come to me or Ben if you have any trouble getting a copy.

Deep Learning is a practical subject, somewhat similar to alchemy. We have to get our fingers dirty and build networks and solve problems. But don't worry: all the code is contained in DLWP.

We learn by doing. Our labs are therefore a fundamental component of the module.


Good luck!

# Learning Outcomes

Students who successfully complete this module will be able to:

Apply the core principles of at least one contemporary AI technique to Implement a contemporary AI technique using state-of-the-art technology
Construct programmes to solve real-world problems through the application of AI algorithms
Construct programmes which apply AI algorithms to creative domains
Evaluate the benefits, drawbacks and possibilities of artificial intelligence with reference to issues of ethics and fairness

In particular, you will be able to design, construct and train deep neural networks with Google's Tensorflow technology. You will understand what kinds of problems can be solved and you will be able to deploy neural networks to produce new artefacts.
